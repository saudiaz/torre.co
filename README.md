# torre.co

The goal is for us to get an idea of your skills/strengths in the areas of web development, software architecture, algorithms, innovation, strategic thinking, autonomy, learning, attention to detail, and communication. If you join our team, you'll be working on the full stack. As such, we'll be evaluating your potential in both front and back end development.
You can access these endpoints:
- GET https://torre.bio/api/bios/$username (gets bio information of $username)
- GET https://torre.co/api/opportunities/$id (gets job information of $id)
- POST https://search.torre.co/opportunities/_search/?[offset=$offset&size=$size&aggregate=$aggregate] and https://search.torre.co/people/_search/?[offset=$offset&size=$size&aggregate=$aggregate] (search for jobs and people in general, you can see how it's being used here: https://torre.co/search).
You can invest as much time as you'd like. Please log your progress. You have 24 hours to complete it.
Your deliverables are:
- A link for us to test what you built
- Your progress log
- A way for us to review your code through a control version system (for example, Github) where we can review your incremental progress
- Anything else you'd like to share with us
